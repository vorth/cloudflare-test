**Photo Life History:** [Bay Natives](http://www.baynatives.com/plants/Aristolochia-californica/)

**Habitat:** [Mountain Canyons](../habitat/mountain-canyons/) of Northern California.

**Host Plants:** [*Aristolochia californica*](http://www.baynatives.com/plants/Aristolochia-californica/)

**Suitable Lab Host Plants:**  Most any species of pipevine will work in the lab.

**Caring for Live Female Butterflies:** [Feed females regularly](../caring-for-live-females.html).

**Methods of Female Oviposition:**  [Open Screen Cages](../female-oviposition2/open-screen-cages/)

**How to Find Eggs:**  Look on  [host plants with new growth.](../finding-eggs-in-the-field/eggs-on-new-growth-or-on-healthy-host-plants/) 

**How to Hatch Eggs:**  [Separate eggs individually](../hatching-eggs/separate-eggs-individually/) (Larvae can be 
cannibalistic.)

**How to Find Caterpillars in the Field:**  

**Caterpillar setups:**
[Open terrariums](../caterpillar-setups/open-terrariums/);
[Open Bucket](../caterpillar-setups/open-bucket/);
[Potted Plant](../caterpillar-setups/potted-plant/)
(Dutchman's pipevine works as an excellent host and is sold in many nurseries in 1 and five gallon pots.)
Regardless of your setup, always remember to provide plenty of host plant for larvae as they can be cannibalistic.

**Larva to Pupa:**  [Larva purges and wanders](../larva-to-pupa/larva-purges/)

**How to Find Pupae in the Field:** Subspecies *hirsuta* have been known to pupate right on the plant and have been found during the winter months.  
Look on dead vines and nearby areas.

**Number of Broods per Year** :  2

**Overwintering Stage:**   Pupa. 

**Overwintering Strategies:**   [Your Own Backyard](../overwintering-techniques/your-own-backyard/);  [Refrigerator](../overwintering-techniques/refrigerator/)

**Post-Hibernation Strategies:** Expose post-diapause pupae to warmer temperatures (room temperature)  [Long-Day Photoperiod](../avoiding-diapause/long-day-photophase/);  [High Humidity](../avoiding-diapause/high-humidity/).  (Mist spray pupae daily once your bring them out of the cold or refrigerator.)

**Avoiding Diapause Techniques:**  Provide larvae with  [healthy host plant](../avoiding-diapause/healthy-host-plant/) and [expose larvae long-day conditions](../avoiding-diapause/long-day-photophase/).

**Disease Prevention:**   Change out host plant and remove frass every four to six days. 

**Emergence:**    [Emergence Container](../emerging-butterflies/)

**Field Notes:**   Flies in Northern California.
