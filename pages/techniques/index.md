  ## {{ title }}

<p>This section represents the substance of this website and is basically broken down into two broad disciplines which include how to obtain immatures--defined as eggs, larvae, or pupae--and how to care of them in order to get healthy adults.  Butterfly rearing techniques and strategies will be reviewed by way of instructions, photos, and a few videos.<span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span>

<p>Although the beginning section of this site introduced some of these techniques as applicable to butterflies that are generally easy to raise, this section will provide much more detail. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the <a href="/raising_butterflies_301/">Taxa Specific</a> section will demonstrate which of these techniques work well for specific butterfly taxa broken down to the species and subspecies level. </p>

<p>It is important to understand how caterpillars hatch from their eggs, feed on their host plant and go through the a series of molts called instars as they develop.  <a href="../caterpillar-development/">More.</a></p>
