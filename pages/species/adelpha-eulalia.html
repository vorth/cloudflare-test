<p><strong>Suitable Lab Host Plants</strong>: <em>Quercus virginiana</em>; <em><a href="../quercus-alba/index.html">Quercus alba</a>&nbsp; </em>(Note: This lab host can be especially helpful for those rearing Arizona sisters during the fall months when scrub oaks drop their leaves in October; but white oak leaves remain useable almost through the month of November.)</p>

<p><strong>Avoiding Diapause Techniques: </strong>&nbsp;<a href="../avoiding-diapause/long-day-photophase/index.html">Expose larvae to 24 hours of light</a>; <a href="../avoiding-diapause/healthy-host-plant/index.html">Healthy Host Plant</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; To be honest very few who have reared this butterfly have been able to create conditions where larvae do diapause.&nbsp; From what I know, only COL. Clyde F. Gillette has been able to do this.&nbsp; He reports that diapausing larvae do not build hibernacula; but crawl off the leaf to overwinter near the trunk of the tree.</p>
<p><strong>Disease Prevention:</strong>&nbsp; Change out host plant and remove frass every five days.</p>
