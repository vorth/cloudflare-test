**Photo Life History:** _[Adelpha californica](../a-californica-immatures-photos/index.html)_

**Habitat:**  [Cismontane California Chaparral](http://www.californiachaparral.com/awheresthechaparral.html); [Riparian Woodlands](http://butterfliesofamerica.com/adelpha_californica_habitats.htm)

**Host Plants:**  _Quercus chrysolepsis; Quercus agrifolia; Quercus chrysophylla; Quercus douglasii_

**Suitable Lab Host Plants**: _[Quercus alba](../quercus-alba/index.html)_  (Almost any species of oaks will work in the lab.)

**How to Find Female Butterflies:**  Click [here](../collecting-live-female-butterf/index.html). 

**Caring for Live Female Butterflies:**  [Nectaring techniques](../caring-for-live-females.html)

**Methods of Female Oviposition:**  [Open Screen Cages](../female-oviposition2/open-screen-cages/index.html); [Plant Sleeves](../female-oviposition2/potted-plant-sleeves/index.html); Expose caged females to filtered sunlight.  See notes below.

**How to Find Eggs:** [Look on tips of leaves](../finding-eggs-in-the-field/eggs-on-the-tips-of-leaves/index.html).

**How to Hatch Eggs:**  [Keep egg on original leaf](http://indroid.squarespace.com/hatching-eggs/keep-egg-on-original-leaf/); keep relatively humid.

**How to Find Caterpillars in the Field:** [Isolated host plants](http://utahbutterflies.ning.com/video/finding-caterpillars-on); [perches on tips of leaves](http://www.raisingbutterflies.org/picture/l_w_latifascia_1stinstar2.jpg?pictureId=3071037).  Sometimes larvae are easier to find when adult butterflies are very common; even when oaks are common as well.  (See notes below.)

**Caterpillar setups:**  [Open terrariums](../caterpillar-setups/open-terrariums/index.html); [Open Bucket](../caterpillar-setups/open-bucket/index.html)

**Larva to Pupa:**  [Caterpillar silks to leaf or twig; creates and attaches cremaster; hanging as a J before pupating.](../larva-to-pupa/larva-hangs-as-a-j/index.html)  [Larva Changes Color](../larva-to-pupa/larva-changes-color/index.html) from green to tan.

**How to Find Pupae in the Field:** 

**Number of Broods per Year**:  2-4 depending upon location.

**Overwintering Stage:** 

**Overwintering Strategies:**  [Your Own Backyard](../overwintering-techniques/your-own-backyard/index.html); [Refrigerator](../overwintering-techniques/refrigerator/index.html)

**Post-Hibernation Strategies:** 

**Avoiding Diapause Techniques:**  [Expose larvae to 24 hours of light](../avoiding-diapause/long-day-photophase/index.html); [Healthy Host Plant](../avoiding-diapause/healthy-host-plant/index.html).  

**Disease Prevention:**  Change out host plant and remove frass every five days.

**Emergence:**  [Emergence Container](../emerging-butterflies/index.html)

**Field Notes:** Eggs and caterpillars were not too difficult to find on local oaks at the Desert View Picnic Area; 0.4 miles south of Stephenson Peak, San Diego County, CA on 22 Jun 1991.  Live females also laid eggs on a sleeve of _Quercus gambellii_ growing in a semi-shaded area of the mountains.
